the GitHub repository name to reconstruct the full path to your local project.
1. The checkbox option **Shallow clone with a truncated history of [N] commits** allows you to truncate the commit 
   history.

After cloning the repository, you can view the commit history and make new pull requests in your repository. To check the commit history, click on the **Git** button in the left corner or use <shortcut>Alt+9</shortcut> on Windows and <shortcut>âŒ˜ Cmd+9</shortcut> on macOS:
